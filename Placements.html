    <h style="color:blue">PLACEMENTS</h>

    <p>Anil Neerukonda Institute of Technology & Sciences has established a separate Training & Placements Dept, 
headed by a full time Dean (Training & Placements) assisted by 7 faculty members as ‘Faculty Coordinators’ to maximize the opportunities for all our 
students in software as well as core sectors.
<br>
All the students are given Campus Recruitment Training on Quantitative Techniques, 
Logical Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, English Grammar, Group Discussions, 
How to face an interview etc during their pre-final year. 
For this, we have full time in-house expert trainers on the above mentioned subjects.
<br>
We take critical feed back from our recruiters at the end of their recruitment process, 
collect performance of our alumni working with them; and implement them in the next training sessions 
for better performance. Hence, majority of our recruiters are repeated.
<br>
We have sufficient logistic support like AC Auditorium (400 occupancy), 
Examination Halls (500-occupancy at-one-go), AC interview rooms etc for on/pooled campus selections.
<br>
With the co-ordination of all these stake holders, 
we could increase our placement percentage year on year and serve the student community.
<br>
We are proud to say that ANITS ranked in the Top-Ten 
Most Preferred Colleges out of 700+ private engineering colleges in the state of AP 
(as per APSCHE, the body which conducts engineering admissions in the state).</p>
